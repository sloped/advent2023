# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1 Challenges

### Challenge 1
- The first challenge was straightforward and was solved quickly on the first attempt.

### Challenge 2
- This challenge proved to be more complex than initially anticipated.
- Initially, there was a misunderstanding in the handling of strings like 'eighthree', which should be interpreted as '83' rather than '8'. This required a significant change in approach.
- Another issue was with strings containing a single digit; they were incorrectly converted to one digit instead of two, as in the first solution.
- After addressing these issues, the correct answer was successfully obtained.
